# Intelligent Systems

These projects were developed as part of the *Intelligent Systems* course and focus on implementing **heuristic-based search algorithms** to solve different state-space problems.

The primary goal is to demonstrate how **informed search strategies** (such as A\*) can solve complex problems more efficiently than **uninformed methods** (like BFS or DFS).

Each project involves a specific problem domain, a well-defined state representation, and the implementation of one or more heuristic functions to guide the search process.
